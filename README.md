First you will see a page to enter the team number, scouter name, alliance side, and match number of the team that you will be scouting. Check with the scouting schedule to find your team team number. Click the alliance side on which they are in relation to where you are sitting. This will make the following screens easier to follow. Note that it will tell you to `Fill in the data fields correctly!` and not allow you to proceed if you enter any invalid numbers. After entering the fields, click the blue `Continue` button.

Click the checkbox where the robot scores. Click the dropdown for the hybrid nodes and click what the robot had placed in that node. Note that the robot cannot put cones on the platform for cubes, the app should prevent you from doing so. Check the mobility checkbox if the robot cross the line that encompasses the community. If the robot gets on the Charging station or the platform in the middle click the `Docked` checkbox. Additionally, if the light turn on and the platform is balanced click the `Engaged` button. If a robot does not do any of the above leave it blank.

The same things for auto also apply to teleop. Make sure that you are specifically putting only the on the game pieces during teleop. You can tell when auto has finished when a sound plays and the drive teams are able to control their robots.

Some robots focus on being defensive rather than scoring points. If the robot you are scouting only does this, select `Yes` and make additionals note on how well they defend in the `Additional Notes` section. Otherwise, just leave it blank.

Some robots may stop moving or not move at all during the match. If this happens click the yes button under the Robot did not move box.

Enter any additional notes on the team's performance in the `Notes` section.

When you are done, click the blue `Submit Session` button at the bottom of the final page to submit the data. 

To save the data to your computer click the export button. NEVER CLOSE YOUR TAB WITHOUT CLICKING EXPORT. If you choose to, you can click export after every session submit.
